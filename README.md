# AllEuroLeagueFirstTeam

This project aims at predicting the five players who will win the 'All-EuroLeague First Team' award.
The award is given since the 2000/2001 season to the best players of a regular season. online fan voting accounts for 25% of the vote total, while media voting for the remaining 75%.

STEP 1. Scraping all the data about the players and the teams from all desired years from the 'Euroleague' offical website and store it into a pandas dataframe.


STEP 2. Scraping the winners in the award from all desired years from 'RealGM' website and store it into a pandas dataframe.



STEP 3.Cleaning the data from the first dataframe and the second dataframe.



STEP 4. Using the information regarding the second dataframe, I added a new column called 'won' to the first dataframe. and now this is the main data frame I will work from now on.


STEP 5. Visualize and EDA.


STEP 6. Machine learning - implementing machine learning; Supervised learning method 'Logistic Regression' to predict the 'All-EuroLeague' Team for a current season.


STEP 7. Evaluate the model.
